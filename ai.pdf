(2.1 - An agent perceives its environment through sensors and acts via actuators.) Tj
0 -14 Td
(The environment is everything external to the agent that it interacts with.) Tj
0 -14 Td
(Examples: self driving car, chess program.) Tj

(2.2 - Evolution shapes priors and innate mechanisms across generations.) Tj
0 -14 Td
(Autonomy and intelligence can arise as evolved capacities for decision making.) Tj
0 -14 Td
(Learning provides within lifetime plasticity.) Tj

(2.3 - PEAS for taxi driving: Performance safety timely arrival comfort fuel efficiency.) Tj
0 -14 Td
(Environment: road network, traffic, weather, pedestrians.) Tj
0 -14 Td
(Actuators: steering, throttle, brakes, indicators.) Tj
0 -14 Td
(Sensors: GPS, cameras, lidar, radar, speedometer, passenger inputs.) Tj

(2.4 - Classic vacuum world with deterministic actions and exact sensors is deterministic and fully observable.) Tj
0 -14 Td
(It can be episodic or sequential and may be static or dynamic.) Tj
0 -14 Td
(2.5 - Agent types: simple reflex, model based reflex, goal based, utility based, learning agents.) Tj
0 -14 Td
(2.6 - Rational vacuum agent: maintain map, clean if dirty, else move to nearest known dirty.) Tj
0 -14 Td
(2.7 - Use belief states and update with observations; explore or use POMDP planning.) Tj
0 -14 Td
(2.8 - BFS optimal memory heavy, DFS low memory may miss shortest paths, A star with admissible heuristic is typically best.) Tj
0 -14 Td
(2.9 - Unknown geography: map and frontier based exploration; TD often learns faster than sample averages.) Tj
0 -14 Td
(2.10 - Passive learning evaluates a fixed policy. Direct utility estimation averages returns and is slower. TD updates online and typically converges faster.) Tj
